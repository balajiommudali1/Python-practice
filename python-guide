============= Installing Python 3 on Debian/Ubuntu======================
$ sudo su -
[root] $ apt update -y
[root] $ apt install -y \
  wget \
  build-essential \
  libssl-dev \
  zlib1g-dev \
  libbz2-dev \
  libreadline-dev \
  libsqlite3-dev \
  libncurses5-dev \
  libncursesw5-dev \
  xz-utils \
  tk-dev

[root] $ cd /usr/src
[root] $ wget http://python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/Python-3.6.4.tar.xz
[root] $ tar xf Python-3.6.4.tar.xz
[root] $ cd Python-3.6.4.tar.xz
[root] $ ./configure --enable-optimizations
[root] $ make altinstall
[root] $ exit

Note: make altinstall causes it to not replace the built in python executable.

Ensure that secure_path in /etc/sudoers file includes /usr/local/bin. The line should look something like this:

Defaults        secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin
Upgrade Pip (Might not be Necessary)
The version of pip that we have might be up-to-date, but it’s good practice to try to update it after the installation. We need to use the pip3.6 executable because we’re working with Python 3, and we use sudo so that we can write files under the /usr/local directory.

$ sudo pip3.6 install --upgrade pip.

================Histoty and Benefinits==============

- Created by Guido van Rossum
- First Appearance in 1991
- Used and supported by tech giants like Google and Youtube
- Supported two major versions of nearly a decade.

Language Features

- Object oriented Scripting Language.
- Dynamic & Strong Type System
- Functional Concepts ( Map, Reduce, Fileter and etc)
- Whitespace delimited with pseudo-code like syntax.

Key Points About Python:

Object-Oriented Scripting Language.
Dynamic & strong typing system.
Dynamic types are checked at runtime
Strong types don’t change implicitly, can’t add 1 and "something".
Supports functional concepts like map, reduce, filter, and list comprehension.
Whitespace delimited (no { or } around code blocks)
Pseudo-code like syntax
Extremely popular language used across many different disciplines (academia, data science, scripting, web development, etc.).
Large open source community and public package index (Pypi).
Runs on all major operating systems (historically more of a pain to run on Windows than Unix systems). Pre-installed on most *NIX systems (usually Python 2).
Supported by large companies such as Google & YouTube.
Consistently high on the Tiobe Index (one of the most searched programming languages). 4th as of the time of recording this.
Placed in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey’s top 10 for Most Popular Programming Languages, Most Loved Programming Languages, and placed number 1 as the “Most Wanted Language” (meaning it’s the language that deve
lopers want to use the most).
